# CS3700: Bridge

## Project Overview
I implemented a simple bridge that is able to establish a spanning tree and forward packets between its various ports. This project ran on a simulation environment that emulates LANs and end hosts. My bridge constructed a spanning tree and disabled any ports that are not part of the tree. My bridge forwarded packets among the ports and learned the locations (ports) of  the hosts. Lastly, my bridge is able to handle both bridge and port failures by automatically reconfiguring spanning tree based on timeouts.
